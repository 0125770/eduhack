                About EduHack
            </h4>
            <p class="tab-content">
                EduHack is a collaborative hackathon with participants of
                different discipline. We do not only focus on technology
                developers but also on business, designers, and educators. From
                this perspective, we will have numerous ideas from
                different viewpoints that can lead to a more synergistic
                solution to enhance education quality together.
                <br>
                <br>
                EduHack is open for any full time undergraduate student studying
                in Malaysia. To us, hackathons are a great opportunity
                to learn, grow and make mistakes in a safe environment.
                <br>
                br
                In EduHack, a total of 20 teams will be given 24 hours to
                develop a project in a team at Sunway iLabs. The topic of
                EduHack is quality education. In today’s rapid transformation
                has led to many changes in our daily life. The quality of
                education will have to follow suit to consistently improve to
                better educate the generations to come. If you have a
                great idea to enhance quality education by any means, we highly
                encourage you to participate as you may be on to
                something big.

            <p>
                We are the committees of Sunway Tech Club, an undergraduate
                student-run university club founded on a vision to build a
                community of students aspire to bridge the gap of tech
                education, industry, and technopreneurship.
                <br>
                <br>
                We are highly committed to form a community and culture to
                inspire students to be creative, innovative, and
                collaborative beyond the classrooms. To date, Sunway Tech Club
                has successfully run industry talk events, technical
                workshops, co-hosted internationally known tech festival,
                hackathons, and many others more to come. Hence, as committees
                of Sunway Tech Club, we are highly committed and inspired to
                bring EduHack to you.
